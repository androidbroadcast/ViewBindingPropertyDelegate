## 1.5.4
December 23, 2021

- Bug fixes
- Improve error messages

## 1.5.3
November 19, 2021

- Fix clearing of a Fragment when it is destroyed 

## 1.5.2
November 13, 2021

### New feature "Strict mode"
New library mode to check correctness of ViewBinding usage. Enabled by default.
Call ViewBindingPropertyDelegate.strictMode = false to switch to old behavior

### Added a callback called when a ViewBinding inside ViewBindingProperty is destroyed
Callback is triggered when a ViewBinding in ViewBindingPropertyDelegate is destroyed
Instead of overriding Fragment.onDestroyView(), use

```kotlin
viewBinding(
    ..., 
    onViewDestroyed = { vb: ViewBinding ->
        // reset views inside the ViewBinding 
    }
)
```

### ViewBindingProperty will throw an error if it is created before the host is ready
ViewBindingPropertyDelegate throws an exception if it is used before the host
(Fragment, Activity, etc.) is ready to create a ViewBinding. As an example, accessing
ViewBindingPropertyDelegate in a Fragment, before onViewCreated() has been called, will now throw
an Exception.
