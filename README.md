# ViewBindingPropertyDelegate

Make work with [Android View Binding](https://d.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) simpler. The library:
- manages ViewBinding lifecycle and clears the reference to it to prevent memory leaks
- eliminates the need to keep nullable references to Views or ViewBindings
- creates ViewBinding lazily

The library comes in two variants: with and without reflection. The artifacts are respectively: `vbpd` and `vbpd-reflection`. **Prefer to use the one without reflection for better performance**

## IMPORTANT: Enable ViewBinding before using the library
Each Gradle module in your project where you need to use ViewBinding must be properly configured. Refer to the [official guide](https://d.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) on how to do that 

## Add the library to a project

```kotlin
allprojects {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}

dependencies {
    // recommended
    implementation("dev.androidbroadcast.vbpd:vbpd:2.0.2")
    
    // additional factories that use reflection under hood
    implementation("dev.androidbroadcast.vbpd:vbpd-reflection:2.0.1")
}
```

## Samples

```kotlin
import javax.swing.text.View

class ProfileFragment : Fragment(R.layout.profile) {
   // RECOMMENDED 
   // no reflection API is used under the hood
   private val profileBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding(ProfileBinding::bind)

   override fun onViewCreated(view: View) {
       super.onViewCreate(view)
       with(profileBinding) {
          firstName.text = person.name
          lastName.text = person.surname
          email.text = person.email
       }
   }

   override fun onViewDestroyed() {
      super.onViewDestroyed()
      // profileBinding will be cleared after onViewDestroyed()
   }
}
```

## Migration from 1.0

You can use 1.X and 2.X in the same project without replacing code

- Replace packages `com.github.kirich1409.viewbindingpropertydelegate` -> `dev.androidbroadcast.vbpd`
- Replace `onViewDestroyed` with moving code to proper lifecycle callback (Fragment.onViewDestroyed(), Activity.onDestroy(), etc.)
