# ViewBindingPropertyDelegate

Make work with [Android View Binding](https://d.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) simpler. The library do:
- managing ViewBinding lifecycle and clear reference to it to prevent memory leaks
- you don't need to keep nullable reference to Views or ViewBindings
- create ViewBinding lazy

The library has two variants: reflection and without it. They were divided in separate artifacts: `viewbindingpropertydelegate` and `viewbindingpropertydelegate-noreflection`. **Prefer to use variant without reflection for better performance**

## IMPORTANT: Enable ViewBinding before use the library
Every Gradle module of your project where you need use ViewBinding must be configured properly. How to do that you can find in the [official guide](https://d.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)

## Add library to a project

```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.kirich1409:viewbindingpropertydelegate:1.5.0-beta01'
    
    // To use only without reflection variants of viewBinding
    implementation 'com.github.kirich1409:viewbindingpropertydelegate-noreflection:1.5.0-beta01'
}
```

## Samples

```kotlin
class ProfileFragment : Fragment(R.layout.profile) {

    // Using reflection API under the hood and ViewBinding.bind
    private val viewBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding()

    // Using reflection API under the hood and ViewBinding.inflate
    private val viewBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding(createMethod = CreateMethod.INFLATE)

    // Without reflection
    private val viewBinding by viewBinding(ProfileBinding::bind)
}
```

```kotlin
class ProfileActivity : AppCompatActivity(R.layout.profile) {

    // Using reflection API under the hood
    private val viewBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding(R.id.container)

    // Without reflection
    private val viewBinding by viewBinding(ProfileBinding::bind, R.id.container)
}
```
