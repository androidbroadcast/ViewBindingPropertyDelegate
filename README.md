# ViewBindingPropertyDelegate

Make work with [Android View Binding](https://d.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) simpler. The library:
- manages ViewBinding lifecycle and clears the reference to it to prevent memory leaks
- eliminates the need to keep nullable references to Views or ViewBindings
- creates ViewBinding lazily

The library comes in two flavors: with and without reflection. The artifacts are respectively: `viewbindingpropertydelegate` and `viewbindingpropertydelegate-noreflection`. **Prefer to use the one without reflection for better performance**

## IMPORTANT: Enable ViewBinding before using the library
Each Gradle module in your project where you need to use ViewBinding must be properly configured. Refer to the [official guide](https://d.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) on how to do that 

## Add the library to a project

```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}

dependencies {
    // reflection-based flavor
    implementation 'com.github.kirich1409:viewbindingpropertydelegate:1.5.6'
    
    // reflection-free flavor
    implementation 'com.github.kirich1409:viewbindingpropertydelegate-noreflection:1.5.6'
}
```

## Samples

```kotlin
class ProfileFragment : Fragment(R.layout.profile) {

    // reflection API and ViewBinding.bind are used under the hood
    private val viewBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding()

    // reflection API and ViewBinding.inflate are used under the hood
    private val viewBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding(createMethod = CreateMethod.INFLATE)

    // no reflection API is used under the hood
    private val viewBinding by viewBinding(ProfileBinding::bind)
}
```

```kotlin
class ProfileActivity : AppCompatActivity(R.layout.profile) {

    // reflection API is used under the hood
    private val viewBinding: ProfileBinding by viewBinding(R.id.container)

    // no reflection API is used under the hood
    private val viewBinding by viewBinding(ProfileBinding::bind, R.id.container)
}
```
